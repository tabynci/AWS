# In the below program to add two numbers in Python, the user is first asked to enter two numbers, and the input is scanned using the Python input() function and stored in the variables number1 and number2. Then, the variableâ€™s number1 and number2 are added using the arithmetic operator +, and the result is stored in the variable sum.

# def add(x, y):
#     x= input("Enter you number")
#     y=input("ENter your secod number")

#     Z= int(x)+int(y)
#     print(f"The sum of two number are", Z)

# add(2, 3)
